        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I came up with this idea one morning when my son wanted hash browns, but I didn't want to do all the chopping and such. So, I just baked a potato and stuffed all the other breakfast items inside. He loved it and is now making it on his own! And there are many options with this dish.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large russet potato</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>⅛ pound sausage, or as desired</li>
            <li>2 slices bacon</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rub potato with vegetable oil and salt. Prick several times with a fork and wrap in aluminum foil. Place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until squeezable yet firm, about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>While potato is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Set sausage aside in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in the large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Let cool slightly; crumble.</li>
            <li>Remove potato from the oven. Slice in the center to create a pocket; add 2 tablespoons butter, salt, and pepper to the potato. Stuff potato with crumbled sausage and bacon.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour egg mixture into skillet and scramble to desired doneness, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place scrambled eggs on top of meat in potato. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top of warm eggs.</li>
        </ol>
